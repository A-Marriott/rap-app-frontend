Welcome! Rap app frontend is the react code used to run rap-app, which serves you up a constant stream of youtube videos from a list of possible hip-hop instrumentals, as well as providing rhyming words and a creative writing prompt to inspire your freestyle.

Before using the frontend component, make sure the [backend server](https://github.com/A-Marriott/rap-app) is up and running. 

Once you have done this, make sure you have the necessary tools to run a react app, as found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). 

All you will need to do now is run 
```
npm start
```
Your CLI will ask you to run on another server, as localhost:3000 will already be running from your rails app. Accept this, and once you do, you should find the app running on localhost:3001. Play around and enjoy!
